# Rocksmash!

A simple game to play rock, paper, scissors against the computer. Keeps a tally for the user and announces the winner once the game is reset.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used a simple random number generator as the base of this game, I then added user interaction through images and buttons to allow the user to play against the computer. The addition of a tally allowed the site to keep track and announce a winner once the game is reset. A simple but fun project to work on.

## Optimizations

If I were to improve this site, I would incorporate the 4 OOP pillars to refactor and tidy my code up.

## Lessons Learned:

The complexities involved in having user interaction through event listeners and how to organise larger blocks of code.
